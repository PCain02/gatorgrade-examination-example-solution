# The function count_elements should:
# - Take a list of integers, called numbers, as its parameter.
# - Return a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list,
#   and its value is the count of that integer in the list.

# Note: If the function is called with an empty list, it should return an empty dictionary.

# - Take a list of integers, called numbers, and an integer, target_sum, as its parameters.

#   that add up to the target_sum. Ensure each pair is listed only once.
